Many of the creatures within this castle are vessels who should of been bound by the reset, or locked up in the Cosmic Hold. Yet for 
one reason or another exist here, outside of the Akoshic Record. I'm beginning to think the unique massive Graviton force resting in 
the center of this castle has something to do with it.
